# Image scrapping on google images - inspired on https://github.com/debadridtt/Scraping-Google-Images-using-Python
(with small corrections) 

Now  scrape as many images as you want, from google images using Python, Chromdriver and Selenium
**Dependencies needed**
1) `Selenium`
Install as `pip install selenium`
2) [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/?) - Pyhton 3.6+ verion
3) Download `chromedriver.exe`
4) Place your `chromedriver.exe` and `google_image_scraping_script.py` file in the same folder
5) Open your terminal (Command Prompt for Windows) from that location and execute the script by typing `python googe_image_scraping_script.py`

The `error_clicks` parameter is to stop when there are no more results to show and end of the page is reached in Google Images search.

Line 105 change the queries you want to search: `queries = ["Manchester City", "Manchester United", 'Barcelona', 'Real Madrid']` in my case

Line 110 `links = fetch_image_urls(query,200,wd)`, 200 denotes no. of images you want to download 

**Note:** The script runs and scrapes images successfully if the range of no. of images is set somewhere between 200-250 and also if one query is passed at a time instead of a list of multiple queries

   > Open your terminal (`cmd` in Windows) execute the following query:
     `python google_image_scraping_script.py`
     Now in that same directory, you will see a folder `datasets` inside which you will see a folder for each name of search text that you put in. In my case the folder names will be the list of queries that I have passed.

It is recommended to keep your machine idle while the scraping script is running end-to-end.
